# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
In this project we have created an asynchronous web app that uses Web API "openWeather" and user data to dynamically update the UI. 

## Instructions
We have modified the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. We can see `index.html` for element references, oncewe have finished with the project steps, we used `style.css` to style the application to customized perfection.

## Extras
we have made some changes in the css file.
we have added the"&units=metric" in the "const 'apiKey'"  in order to obtain temperature in celsius directly.
